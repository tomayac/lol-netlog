2014-05-23T17-44-09: Net Status: low-level initialize success.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: Note that this new version (12/19/2011) has reduced the frequency of updates so the numbers will be larger
2014-05-23T17-44-09: time = time of logging
2014-05-23T17-44-09: address = address of IP address
2014-05-23T17-44-09: incoming = total size of messages set to me in bytes. Spikes can indicate lag.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: outgoing = total size of messages set from me in bytes. Spikes can indicate lag.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: app_ctos = client to server bytes delta excluding overheads (app data only)
2014-05-23T17-44-09: app_stoc = server to client bytes delta excluding overheads (app data only)
2014-05-23T17-44-09: loss = number of packets lost. Can indicate lags.  Some node on the network is dropping packets or taking to long and we have to resend them.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: sent = number of packets sent. Spikes can indicate lag.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: ping = how long it takes for a packet to get back and forth. Spikes can indicate lag.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: variance = how much the ping is changing from avg ping. Spikes can indicate lag.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: reliable delayed = This occurs when we drop reliable packets from sending this frame because we are sending to much data. Unreliable are more likely to be dropped than reliable.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: unreliable delayed = This occurs when we drop unreliable packets from sending this frame because we are sending to much data.
2014-05-23T17-44-09: app update delayed = This occurs when the app is taking to long to run code caused by network packets (ie CPU) and packets are delayed until the next frame
2014-05-23T17-44-09: Time spent in critical section (frame) = This is the time the network thread is blocking the main thread from doing anything.
