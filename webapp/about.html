<h1><a class="nodeco" href="http://logsoflag.com/">Logs of Lag</a></h1>

<p>
<a class="nodeco" href="http://logsoflag.com/">Logs of Lag</a>
is a browser tool for parsing League of Legends
network logs. These logs are written by the LoL game client and
are useful for understanding the kinds of lag you see when playing
the game.
</p>

<p>
After dropping a logfile onto the browser window, the page will analyze the log
locally on your computer and present a summary and a graph. The most important number
in the summary table is "packets lost/s". Small numbers like 0.02/s are generally OK,
losses greater than 0.10/s are bad. Median and best ping are interesting as well as
they characterize the general latency you see during a game. 20–200ms is typical, it
usually depends on your distance to Riot's data centers.
</p>

<p>The graph below the table shows a timeline of ping
(blue) and packets lost (red), once every 10 seconds.
Note that the "ping" reported in the LoL client is a
combination of round trip time to the server as well as
transient problems with packet buffering or loss. Ping is normally stable
unless there's packet lost.
Bursts of packet loss are what causes noticeable lag in the game: pauses,
rubberbanding, drifting, etc. Packet loss is typically caused by a congested network,
whether your home router, your ISP, or Riot's network.

<p>
Log files are optionally uploaded to my server so that reports can be shared with
other people. I may also use these logs for development and testing purposes. I
intend to not reveal any personally identifiable information.
The raw netlogs I keep privately are mostly anonymous (no user name),
but occasionally contain your computer's IP address.
The parsed logs used in shared reports should be entirely anonymous and not
contain your IP address.
</p>

<p>
This tool is implemented as an HTML5 application using
drag-and-drop files and SVG graphs (with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>).
It should work in any modern browser.
I develop on Chrome and occasionally test on Firefox
and Safari. I do not have access to MSIE, but it should probably work
in IE 10. No attempt has been made to make this tool useful on mobile devices.</p>

<p>
I was inspired by <a href="http://www.lolparse.com/">lolparse.com</a>,
an excellent browser tool for parsing R3d logs to show you gameplay statistics
like most played champions. It's a great site, try it!
